Machine Learning Predictive model - Logistic Regression on the quality of red wine

I built a Multiclass Logistic Regression model that predicts the quality of red wine in range of 1 to 10

Link to the Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv

The predictive model is built following the steps below:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - understanding the dataset and the underlying interactions between the different variables

Data Pre-processing - preparing the data for modelling

Building the model

Evaluating the performance of the model, and possibly fine-tune and tweak it if necessary

The goal of the model is to predict the quality of red wine in range of 1 to 10
